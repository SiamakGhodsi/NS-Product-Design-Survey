# Contributing

This repository is the companion to our survey **Neuro-Symbolic AI for Product Design**, maintained as two synchronized resources:

- **ORKG (canonical table):** structured, queryable, continuously updated comparison  
  https://orkg.org/comparisons/R1569149
- **GitHub (this repo):** curated browsing, taxonomy figures, issues/PR workflow, release notes

We welcome contributions of **new papers**, **corrections**, **reclassification (Types I–VI)**, and **stronger evidence notes** (datasets, benchmarks, metrics, constraints/objectives).

---

## Quick workflow (fork → PR → merge)

1. **Fork** this repo.
2. Create a branch in your fork and commit changes.
3. Open a **Pull Request** to the **main** branch of this repo.
4. If accepted, your PR will be **merged into main**.

If you’re unsure about classification, open an issue first.

## What to contribute

### A) Add a paper (recommended: ORKG → GitHub)
1) **Add/update in ORKG (preferred / canonical):**  
   https://orkg.org/comparisons/R1569149  
   Fill fields and add a concise “Key contribution & evidence” note.

2) **Update GitHub (optional but encouraged):**
- Add the paper to `README.md` under the correct **Type (I–VI)** section.
- Use **one canonical link** (DOI preferred; else OpenReview; else arXiv).
- Include **title + year + venue**.

### B) Fix an entry
Examples: year/venue/link errors, wrong Type, missing tags, unclear evidence.

## Minimal quality rules

- Prefer **verifiable sources** (DOI / publisher / proceedings).
- Keep summaries **neutral** (no promotional language).
- If a paper fits multiple types/domains, choose the **dominant** one and note alternatives briefly.

## PR checklist

- [ ] ORKG updated (or issue opened explaining why not yet)
- [ ] README placed under correct **Type (I–VI)**
- [ ] Canonical link + correct year/venue
- [ ] Evidence-based, short description
